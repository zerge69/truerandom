This is an example on how to use the truerandom.py module:

-------------------------------------------
import truerandom

min=0

max=100

amount=20

mylist=[]

mylist=truerandom.getnum(min,max,amount)

for n in mylist:
    print n
-------------------------------------------

You have to provide the minimum and maximum numbers in the random list you want to generate, as well as the amount of numbers.
mylist will contain the true random numbers generated in int type.

The numbers are generated by www.random.org, using atmosferic noise.

If the module is unable to pull the random numbers from the website (network problems, server down, etc.) mylist will contain only -1.
